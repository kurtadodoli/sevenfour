- **Status Indicators**: Visual confirmation of assignment status

### 🎛️ Completely Redesigned Action Buttons

#### **Unscheduled Orders**
- **Prominent Scheduling Button**: Large, green gradient button with proper spacing
- **Clear Call-to-Action**: "Schedule Delivery & Assign Courier"
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Single, focused action with proper emphasis

#### **Scheduled Orders**
- **Action Header**: Clear section title with gradient background
- **Button Organization**:
  - **Primary Actions Row**: Delivered (green) + In Transit (blue)
  - **Management Actions Row**: Delay (yellow) + Cancel (red)
  - **Special States**: Dedicated buttons for delayed/cancelled orders
  - **Danger Zone**: Separated remove actions with clear labeling

#### **Button Styling**

- **Responsive Layout**: Flexible button arrangements

### 📦 Enhanced Product Display
