# Custom Order Production Timeline - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Feature Overview

The Custom Order Production Timeline feature has been successfully implemented for the Seven Four Clothing delivery management system. This feature provides a visual 15-day production timeline for custom orders, showing progress from production start to delivery readiness.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Production Start Date Selection**
- Added "🎨 Set Production Start" button for custom orders without production timelines
- Button appears in the Order Management section for custom orders
- Clicking the button allows users to select a future date from the calendar
- Prevents selection of past dates with validation

### 2. **15-Day Production Timeline**
- Automatically calculates completion date as start date + 15 days
- Creates visual timeline in the calendar for all 15 days
- Shows production progress as a percentage (0% to 100%)

### 3. **Calendar Visual Indicators**
- **🚀 Green Circle**: Production start date marker
- **✨ Orange Circle**: Production completion date marker  
- **Progress Bars**: Daily progression with gradient fill (green to orange)
- **🎨 Purple Circle**: Custom order indicator on all timeline days
- **Day markers**: Every 5th day milestone indicators

### 4. **Order Type Detection**
- Updated code to recognize both `order_type: 'custom'` and `order_type: 'custom_order'`
- Comprehensive detection logic for various custom order formats
- Proper filtering in custom order views

### 5. **Production Status Display**
- Shows "🎨 Production Timeline Active" status for orders with active timelines
- Displays production start and completion dates
- Replaces the "Set Production Start" button once timeline is active

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Calendar Indicators
```
🚀 = Production Start (Green gradient circle)
✨ = Production Complete (Orange gradient circle)  
━━━ = Progress bar (Green to orange gradient, 0-100%)

```
