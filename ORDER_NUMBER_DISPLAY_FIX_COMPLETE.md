# Order Number Display Fix - Complete Resolution

## Problem Description
The order number field was displaying as blank in the expanded row of the Cancellation Requests tab for regular orders, despite having a working fallback chain in the frontend mapping logic.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the backend SQL query in `server/controllers/orderController.js`. The `getCancellationRequests` function was selecting both:
1. `cr.*` (which includes `cr.order_number` from the cancellation_requests table)
2. `o.order_number` (from the orders table)

Since `o.order_number` was selected after `cr.*`, it was overriding the `cr.order_number` field. When the LEFT JOIN to the orders table didn't find a matching record, `o.order_number` would be null, resulting in a blank display.

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Fix (server/controllers/orderController.js)
```sql
-- BEFORE (problematic query)
SELECT 
    cr.*,
    o.order_number,
    -- ... rest of query

-- AFTER (fixed query)
SELECT 
    cr.*,
    -- Prioritize order_number from cancellation_requests table, fallback to orders table
    COALESCE(cr.order_number, o.order_number) as order_number,
    -- ... rest of query
```

### Frontend Cleanup (client/src/pages/TransactionPage.js)
- Removed excessive debug logging
- Maintained the existing fallback chain in the mapping logic
- Ensured `safeDisplayValue` function properly handles the order number display

## Testing Results

### Database Structure Verification
- **Regular cancellation_requests table**: Contains `order_number` field with proper values
- **Custom cancellation_requests table**: Contains `custom_order_id` field with proper values

### End-to-End Test Results
```
âœ… Backend query returned 3 pending requests
ðŸ“‹ After frontend mapping:
   1. ID: 8, Order Number: "ORD17520203403784541", Type: regular
   2. ID: 7, Order Number: "ORD17518584735203314", Type: regular
   3. ID: 6, Order Number: "CUSTOM-MCSS0ZFM-7LW55", Type: custom

âœ… All order numbers are properly displayed!
ðŸŽ‰ The fix is working correctly!
```

## Files Modified

1. **server/controllers/orderController.js** - Fixed the SQL query to properly select order_number
2. **client/src/pages/TransactionPage.js** - Removed debug logging, maintained proper display logic

## Build Status
- âœ… React client builds successfully with warnings only (no errors)
- âœ… Backend query tested and verified
- âœ… End-to-end functionality tested and confirmed

## Verification Steps
1. Backend SQL query now properly returns order numbers for all cancellation requests
2. Frontend mapping logic correctly processes the order numbers
3. UI display properly shows order numbers using the safeDisplayValue function
4. Both regular and custom order cancellation requests display correctly

## Resolution Status
ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE** - The order number blank display issue has been fully resolved. The fix addresses the root cause in the backend query while maintaining the robust frontend fallback logic.
