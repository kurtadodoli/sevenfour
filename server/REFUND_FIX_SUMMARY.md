# Refund Request API Fix - Summary

## Problem
The frontend was receiving a **500 Internal Server Error** when submitting refund requests for custom orders:

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error: "Incorrect integer value: 'custom-CUSTOM-...' for column 'order_id' at row 1"
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the database schema and backend logic:

1. **Database Schema Issue**: The `custom_order_id` column in the `refund_requests` table was defined as `INT`, but custom order IDs are strings (e.g., "CUSTOM-1735842094604-MCNQFDBQ").

2. **Frontend Data Flow**: The frontend was sending custom order IDs in the `order_id` field as strings like "custom-CUSTOM-1735842094604-MCNQFDBQ".

3. **Backend Logic Gap**: While the backend had logic to detect custom orders, the database column type mismatch caused SQL errors.

## Solution

### 1. Database Schema Fix
Changed the `custom_order_id` column type from `INT` to `VARCHAR(255)`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE refund_requests 
MODIFY COLUMN custom_order_id VARCHAR(255) NULL;
```

### 2. Backend Logic Enhancement
Enhanced the refund request endpoint (`/api/orders/refund-request`) to properly handle both order types:

**For Custom Orders:**
- Detects when `order_id` starts with "custom-"
- Strips the "custom-" prefix and stores the result in `custom_order_id`
- Sets `order_id` to `NULL`

**For Regular Orders:**
- Stores the integer value in `order_id`
- Sets `custom_order_id` to `NULL`

### 3. Data Mapping
```javascript
// Custom Order Example:
// Frontend sends: { order_id: "custom-CUSTOM-1735842094604-MCNQFDBQ" }
// Backend stores:  { order_id: null, custom_order_id: "CUSTOM-1735842094604-MCNQFDBQ" }

// Regular Order Example:
// Frontend sends: { order_id: 42 }
// Backend stores:  { order_id: 42, custom_order_id: null }
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Custom Order Refund Requests**: Working correctly  
✅ **Regular Order Refund Requests**: Working correctly  
✅ **Edge Cases**: Different custom order formats handled properly  

## Files Modified

1. **c:\sfc\server\routes\api\orders.js**
   - Enhanced refund request endpoint logic
   - Removed debug logging for production readiness

2. **Database Schema**
   - `refund_requests.custom_order_id` column type changed to VARCHAR(255)

## Verification

The fix was verified with comprehensive API tests covering:
- Regular orders with integer IDs
- Custom orders with string IDs (original problem case)
- Various custom order ID formats
- Frontend payload formats

All tests pass with HTTP 200 responses and successful database insertions.

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The 500 Internal Server Error for refund requests has been completely resolved. Both regular and custom order refund requests now work correctly from the frontend.
