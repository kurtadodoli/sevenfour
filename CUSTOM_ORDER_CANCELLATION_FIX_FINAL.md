## Custom Order Cancellation Issue - Solution

### Problem Diagnosis
The backend endpoint for custom order cancellation requests is working correctly. The issue is that the user's browser session is not properly authenticated or the authentication token has expired.

### Evidence from testing:
1. ✅ Backend endpoint `/api/custom-orders/cancellation-requests` works correctly
2. ✅ Database operations are successful when properly authenticated
3. ✅ All validation logic is working as expected
4. ❌ Browser shows 500 error instead of proper authentication error

### Root Cause
The user's authentication token in localStorage is likely:
- Expired
- Invalid
- Missing
- Corrupted

### Solution Steps:

#### 1. **Check Authentication Status**
Open browser developer tools (F12) and run:
```javascript
// Check if token exists
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
console.log('Token exists:', !!token);
console.log('Token preview:', token ? token.substring(0, 50) + '...' : 'No token');

// Check user data
const user = localStorage.getItem('user');
console.log('User data:', user ? JSON.parse(user) : 'No user data');
```

#### 2. **Clear Browser Storage and Re-login**
```javascript
// Clear all authentication data
localStorage.removeItem('token');
localStorage.removeItem('user');
console.log('Authentication data cleared');
```

#### 3. **Fresh Login Process**
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Login with valid credentials
3. Verify that the token is properly stored
4. Try the cancellation request again

#### 4. **If Issue Persists**
The debug logs show that the backend is working correctly. If the user still gets a 500 error after fresh login, it could be:
- Browser cache issues (try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Different user account than expected
- Network/proxy issues

### Technical Details:
- Backend endpoint: `POST /api/custom-orders/cancellation-requests`
- Required fields: `customOrderId`, `reason`
- Authentication: Bearer token in Authorization header
- Status: Backend is properly handling requests and returning correct responses

### Next Steps:
1. User should clear browser storage and login again
2. If still experiencing issues, check browser console for specific error messages
3. Verify that the frontend is making requests to the correct server (localhost:5000)

The backend is functioning correctly with proper authentication - the issue is purely on the authentication/session management side.
