# Order Cancellation System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
A comprehensive order cancellation system that allows customers to request order cancellations with reasons, and provides administrators with a complete interface to manage these requests.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Customer-Facing Features
- **Cancel Order Modal**: Users can cancel orders from OrderPage.js with a popup modal
- **Cancellation Reason**: Required reason field with validation
- **Status Restrictions**: Only allows cancellation of orders with appropriate statuses (pending, confirmed, processing)
- **User Validation**: Customers can only cancel their own orders
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents multiple pending cancellation requests for the same order

### 2. Admin Interface
- **Tabbed Interface**: TransactionPage.js now has "Confirmed Orders" and "Cancellation Requests" tabs
- **Request Management**: Admins can approve or deny cancellation requests
- **Admin Notes**: Ability to add notes when processing requests
- **Customer Information**: Displays customer names from user database with fallback to invoice data
- **Search & Filter**: Full-text search and status filtering
- **Pagination**: Handles large datasets efficiently

### 3. Backend API
- **New Endpoints**:
  - `PUT /api/orders/:id/cancel` - Create cancellation request (customers)
  - `GET /api/orders/cancellation-requests` - List all requests (admin only)
  - `PUT /api/orders/cancellation-requests/:id` - Process request (admin only)
- **Role-based Access**: Admin-only endpoints with proper authentication
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all inputs
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of who processed requests and when

### 4. Database Schema
- **New Table**: `cancellation_requests`
  - `id` - Primary key
  - `order_id` - Foreign key to orders table
  - `user_id` - Foreign key to users table  
  - `order_number` - Denormalized for quick access
  - `reason` - Customer's cancellation reason
  - `status` - pending/approved/denied
  - `admin_notes` - Admin comments
  - `processed_by` - Admin who processed the request
  - `processed_at` - Processing timestamp
  - `created_at` / `updated_at` - Audit timestamps

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes
- **OrderPage.js**: Added cancel modal with reason input and form validation
- **TransactionPage.js**: 
  - Implemented tabbed interface
  - Added cancellation requests management
  - Enhanced customer name display with database joins
  - Added search and filtering capabilities

### Backend Changes
- **orderController.js**:
  - Modified `cancelOrder` to create requests instead of immediate cancellation
  - Added `getCancellationRequests` for admin interface
  - Added `processCancellationRequest` for approve/deny functionality
  - Fixed SQL queries to properly handle customer name joins
- **orders.js routes**: Added new routes with proper ordering to prevent conflicts

### Database Changes
- Created `cancellation_requests` table with proper relationships
- Fixed SQL parameter handling for pagination
- Ensured proper foreign key constraints

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access control (admin-only endpoints)
- User ownership validation (customers can only cancel own orders)
- JWT authentication middleware
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization

## Testing Completed
- ✅ Customer cancellation flow
- ✅ Admin authentication and authorization
- ✅ API endpoint functionality
- ✅ Database queries and joins
- ✅ Frontend-backend integration
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

## Usage

### For Customers
1. Navigate to OrderPage.js
2. Click "Cancel Order" button
3. Enter cancellation reason in modal
4. Submit request
5. Request is sent to admin for review

### For Administrators  
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to TransactionPage.js
3. Click "Cancellation Requests" tab
4. Review pending requests
5. Approve or deny with optional notes
6. Orders are automatically updated based on decision

## Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/OrderPage.js` - Cancel modal and logic
- `client/src/pages/TransactionPage.js` - Admin interface with tabs
- `server/controllers/orderController.js` - API endpoints and business logic
- `server/routes/api/orders.js` - Route definitions
- `create-cancellation-table.js` - Database setup script
- `create_cancellation_requests_table.sql` - SQL schema

## Database Setup
Run the following to create the cancellation_requests table:
```bash
node create-cancellation-table.js
```

Or execute the SQL directly:
```sql
-- See create_cancellation_requests_table.sql
```

## API Documentation
