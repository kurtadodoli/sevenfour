## APPROVE PAYMENT BUTTON FIX - SUMMARY

### 🐛 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**
The approve payment button in TransactionPage.js was failing with a 500 Internal Server Error. The error was:
```
Error: Data truncated for column 'movement_type' at row 1
```

### 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE**
The `stock_movements` table has an ENUM constraint for the `movement_type` column that only allows:
- 'IN'
- 'OUT' 
- 'ADJUSTMENT'
- 'RETURN'
- 'RESERVED'

The backend code was trying to insert 'APPROVED' which is not in the allowed values.

### ✅ **FIX APPLIED**
**File:** `c:\sfc\server\routes\api\orders.js` (Line ~830)

**Changed from:**
```javascript
VALUES (?, 'APPROVED', ?, ?, 'Payment Approved - Stock Already Deducted', ?, ?, ?)
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
VALUES (?, 'ADJUSTMENT', ?, ?, 'Payment Approved - Stock Already Deducted', ?, ?, ?)
```

And changed the quantity from `item.quantity` to `0` since this is just a logging entry, not an actual stock movement.

### 🧪 **TESTING RESULTS**
✅ Database connection successful
✅ Order lookup successful  
✅ Order status updated: pending → confirmed
✅ Payment status updated: pending → verified
✅ Transaction status updated: pending → confirmed
✅ Invoice status updated: pending_verification → confirmed
✅ Stock movement logged successfully
✅ All database operations completed without errors

### 🎯 **AFFECTED FUNCTIONALITY**
- ✅ Regular order payment approval now works
- ✅ Stock tracking remains accurate
- ✅ Order status progression works correctly
- ✅ Transaction and invoice records are properly updated

### 📝 **NOTES**
- Custom order payment approval was not affected (uses different endpoint)
- The fix maintains data integrity while allowing payment approvals to complete
- Stock was already deducted during order placement, so this is just a logging entry

### 🚀 **READY FOR TESTING**
The approve payment button should now work correctly in the admin interface.
