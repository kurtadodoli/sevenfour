# INVENTORY PAGE STOCK ISSUE - PROPERLY FIXED ‚úÖ

## The Real Problem
The InventoryPage and MaintenancePage were using **completely different data sources**:
- **MaintenancePage**: Used `/api/maintenance/products` 
- **InventoryPage**: Used `/api/inventory/overview-test` (custom API I created)

This meant they would **never** show the same stock numbers, even if the database was correct.

## The Real Solution

### ‚úÖ **Made InventoryPage Use Same Data Source as MaintenancePage**

1. **Changed API Endpoint**:
   ```javascript
   // OLD (wrong):
   fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/api/inventory/overview-test`)
   
   // NEW (correct):
   fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/maintenance/products')
   ```

2. **Used Same Stock Calculation Logic**:
   - Copied the exact same size-color variant processing from MaintenancePage
   - Both pages now calculate stock the same way from the same data
   - Both pages handle the same stock formats (old and new)

3. **Reverted All Port Changes**:
   - Server back to port 3001 (original)
   - Client back to port 3001 (original)
   - Everything back to original working configuration

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ **Now Both Pages Will Show Identical Stock Numbers**:
- Same API endpoint: `/api/maintenance/products`
- Same data processing logic
- Same stock calculation method
- Same database source

### ‚úÖ **Stock Data Source**:
The maintenance API reads from the `products` table's `sizes` field, which contains the size-color variants with stock information that you manage in MaintenancePage.

## Testing

### 1. Restart Server (if needed)
```bash
npm run server
```
Should show: `Server running on port 3001`

### 2. Test API Consistency
```bash
node test-stock-consistency.js
```

### 3. Verify in Browser
1. Open MaintenancePage - note the stock numbers
2. Open InventoryPage - stock numbers should be **identical**
3. Update stock in MaintenancePage
4. Refresh InventoryPage - should show updated numbers

## What Was Wrong Before

‚ùå **Previous approach was fundamentally flawed**:
- Created a separate inventory API
- Used different database queries  
- Different data processing logic
- No connection to the stock data you manage in MaintenancePage

‚úÖ **Now it's correct**:
- Single source of truth (maintenance API)
- Same data processing
- Stock changes in MaintenancePage immediately reflect in InventoryPage
- No database inconsistencies

## Files Changed
- ‚úÖ `client/src/pages/InventoryPage.js` - Now uses maintenance API
- ‚úÖ `server/app.js` - Port back to 3001
- ‚úÖ `server/.env` - Port back to 3001  
- ‚úÖ `client/.env` - API URL back to 3001

**The inventory stock issue is now properly fixed by making both pages use the same data source!** üéâ
