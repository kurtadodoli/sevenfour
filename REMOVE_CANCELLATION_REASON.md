# Cancellation Requests - Remove Reason Column

## Changes Made

### ✅ **COMPLETED**: Removed cancellation reason from Cancellation Requests table

## Summary of Changes:

1. **Removed reason column from main table view**:
   - Removed the reason display div from the table row rendering
   - This was shown as a small text field with overflow ellipsis

2. **Removed reason from expanded row details**:
   - Removed the "Reason:" field from the InfoSection in expanded row view
   - Kept other details like Status and Amount

3. **Updated search functionality**:
   - Removed `request.reason?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)` from the filter function
   - Search now only filters by: order number, customer name, and status

## What remains unchanged:
- **Refund Requests**: Still show reason (different section, different functionality)
- **Modal functionality**: The cancellation modal in OrderPage.js still collects reason for submission
- **Backend storage**: Reasons are still stored in the database, just not displayed in the admin table

## Result:
The Cancellation Requests table in the Transaction Management page now shows:
- Order #
- Date  
- Customer
- Products
- Amount
- Payment
- Status
- Delivery
- Created
- Actions

**The reason column has been completely removed from the table display**, making the table cleaner and more focused on the essential information for administrators to process cancellation requests.

## Build Status: ✅ **SUCCESS**
- Application compiles without errors
- Only ESLint warnings for unused variables (normal)
- All functionality preserved except reason display
