# USER DELETION 500 ERROR FIX COMPLETE

## Problem Summary
Users were experiencing 500 Internal Server Error when trying to delete user accounts from the admin dashboard. The error was:
```
"Unknown column 'customer_id' in 'where clause'"
```

## Root Cause
The admin user deletion endpoint in `server/routes/admin.js` was using incorrect column names in DELETE queries:
- Used `customer_id` instead of `user_id` in orders table
- Used `customer_id` instead of `user_id` in custom_orders table

## Database Schema Analysis
After checking the actual database structure:
- `orders` table uses `user_id` column (not `customer_id`)
- `custom_orders` table uses `user_id` column (not `customer_id`)  
- `custom_designs` table uses `user_id` column (not `customer_id`)
- `user_addresses` and `user_sessions` tables do not exist

## Fix Applied
Updated `server/routes/admin.js` DELETE user endpoint:

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// Delete user's orders
'DELETE FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ?'

// Delete custom orders  
'DELETE FROM custom_orders WHERE customer_id = ?'
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Delete user's orders
'DELETE FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?'

// Delete custom orders
'DELETE FROM custom_orders WHERE user_id = ?'
```

## Testing Results
- âœ… User deletion now works successfully
- âœ… Returns proper success response with user details
- âœ… No more 500 Internal Server Error
- âœ… Admin authentication working correctly

## Test Case
- User ID: 967502321335183 (test1750714849990@example.com)
- Admin: testadmin@example.com
- Result: Successfully deleted with cascading cleanup

## Files Modified
- `c:\sevenfour\server\routes\admin.js` - Fixed column names in DELETE queries

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **RESOLVED** - User deletion feature is now fully functional.

The admin dashboard can now successfully delete user accounts without encountering 500 errors.
