## USER DELETION FIX IMPLEMENTATION

### Issue:
- Delete user endpoint returning 404 error
- Server responding with HTML instead of JSON 
- Authentication middleware not properly applied

### Root Cause:
The admin routes were not properly configured with authentication middleware, causing the endpoints to not be found or accessible.

### Solution Applied:

1. **Fixed Admin Routes Authentication** (in `server/routes/admin.js`):
   ```javascript
   // Ensured this line exists and is properly placed:
   router.use(auth);  // Apply auth middleware to all admin routes
   
   // Updated the delete user route:
   router.delete('/users/:userId', requireAdmin, async (req, res) => {
       // ... existing code
   });
   ```

2. **Verified Route Structure**:
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/admin/users/:userId`
   - Requires: Valid JWT token + Admin role
   - Returns: JSON response

### Testing the Fix:

1. **Restart the Server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node app.js
   ```

2. **Test in Browser Console** (on Dashboard page):
   ```javascript
   // This should now return 401/403 instead of 404
   fetch('/api/admin/users/123', {
     method: 'DELETE',
     headers: {
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`,
       'Content-Type': 'application/json'
     }
   }).then(r => console.log(r.status));
   ```

### Expected Behavior Now:
- ✅ Status 401: Token missing/invalid
- ✅ Status 403: Not admin user  
- ✅ Status 404: User not found (but endpoint exists)
- ✅ Status 200: User deleted successfully
- ❌ Status 404 with HTML: Route not found (this was the original issue)

### Frontend Usage:
The delete button in DashboardPage.js should now work properly:
1. Navigate to Dashboard → User Logs
2. Click the "🗑️ Delete" button for any user
3. Confirm in the dialog
4. User should be deleted successfully

### Security Features:
- Only admin users can delete accounts
- Cannot delete your own account  
- Requires confirmation dialog
- Cascading delete of related data
- Transaction-based deletion with rollback
