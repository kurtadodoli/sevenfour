# Custom Design Requests Fetch Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Description
Custom Design Requests in TransactionPage.js were not displaying all requests because the fetch function was never being called when the tab was activated.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing useEffect Hook**: The `fetchCustomDesignRequests` function was defined but never called
2. **No Tab Activation Trigger**: Unlike other tabs (verify-payment), there was no useEffect to trigger data fetching when the design-requests tab became active
3. **Database and API Working Correctly**: Backend had 5 custom orders and API endpoint was functioning properly

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing useEffect Hook
```javascript
// Fetch custom design requests when the design-requests tab is active
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeTab === 'design-requests') {
    fetchCustomDesignRequests();
  }
}, [activeTab, fetchCustomDesignRequests]);
```

### 2. Enhanced Debugging and Logging
- Added detailed console logging to `fetchCustomDesignRequests` function
- Added debugging information to filtering logic
- Added window object exposure for browser debugging

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- More detailed error logging with response status and data
- Better visibility into API call success/failure

## Validation Results

### Database State
- ✅ 5 custom orders present in database
- ✅ All statuses represented (pending, approved, rejected)
- ✅ Complete data fields available

### API Functionality
- ✅ Backend query returns all 5 orders
- ✅ Data processing adds display fields correctly
- ✅ Authentication properly enforced

### Frontend Logic
- ✅ Filtering works for all search terms
- ✅ Data processing handles display names and status formatting
- ✅ useEffect hook properly triggers on tab activation

## Files Modified

### Primary Fix
- `c:\sfc\client\src\pages\TransactionPage.js`
  - Added missing useEffect hook for tab activation
  - Enhanced debugging in fetchCustomDesignRequests function
  - Added debug logging to filtering logic

### Validation Scripts Created
- `c:\sfc\validate-custom-design-fix.js` - Comprehensive validation
- `c:\sfc\debug-custom-design-fetch.js` - Database query testing
- `c:\sfc\test-custom-orders-query.js` - API query testing
- `c:\sfc\check-custom-orders-schema.js` - Schema verification

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Tab Activation**: When user clicks on "Custom Design Requests" tab, the fetchCustomDesignRequests function will be called
2. **Data Loading**: All 5 custom orders will be fetched from the API
3. **Display**: All requests will be visible in the interface with proper formatting
4. **Search/Filter**: Users can search and filter through all requests
5. **Console Logging**: Detailed debug information available in browser console

## Testing Instructions

1. Open TransactionPage.js in browser
2. Click on "Custom Design Requests" tab
3. Verify that all 5 requests are displayed
4. Test search functionality with various terms
5. Check browser console for debug information

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The issue where not all Custom Design Requests were fetched in TransactionPage.js has been resolved. All custom design requests should now be visible when the design-requests tab is activated.
