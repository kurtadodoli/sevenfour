# Real-Time Stock Management System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive real-time stock management system has been implemented for the Seven Four Clothing e-commerce application. The system automatically handles stock subtraction/restoration and provides real-time updates across all application pages.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Enhancements
**File: `server/controllers/orderController.js`**
- Enhanced order confirmation and cancellation endpoints to include stock update event data
- Added `stockUpdate` field to API responses containing:
  - `productId`: ID of the affected product
  - `operation`: 'subtract' or 'restore'
  - `quantity`: Amount changed
  - `newStock`: Updated stock level
  - `timestamp`: When the change occurred

### 2. Frontend Core Components

#### StockContext (`client/src/context/StockContext.js`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized stock state management
- **Features**:
  - Fetches stock data from `/api/maintenance/products`
  - Provides real-time stock updates via localStorage events
  - Offers `fetchStockData()` method for manual refresh
  - Maintains `stockData` object with product stock information
- **Usage**: Wrap components with `<StockProvider>` and use `useStock()` hook

#### StockStatusWidget (`client/src/components/StockStatusWidget.js`)
- **Purpose**: Reusable component for displaying real-time stock status
- **Features**:
  - Shows total products, low stock alerts, out of stock count
  - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
  - Responsive design with loading states
  - Visual indicators for stock health

### 3. Page Integrations

#### App.js
- **Enhancement**: Wrapped with `StockProvider` for global stock state access

#### OrderPage.js  
- **Enhancement**: 
  - Uses `StockContext` for stock updates
  - Processes stock update events from order confirmation/cancellation API responses
  - Broadcasts stock changes via localStorage for real-time updates

#### MaintenancePage.js
- **Enhancement**:
  - Integrated with `StockContext`
  - Refreshes stock data after product add/edit operations
  - Uses centralized stock data for display

#### InventoryPage.js
- **Enhancement**:
  - Full integration with `StockContext`
  - Real-time stock display and updates
  - Consistent stock data presentation

#### ProductsPage.js
- **Enhancement**:
  - Integrated `StockContext` for real-time stock data
  - Modified `getTotalStock()` to use context data when available
  - Added `StockStatusWidget` to header
  - Refreshes stock data during product fetching

#### DashboardPage.js
- **Enhancement**:
  - Added `StockStatusWidget` to provide admin overview
  - Real-time stock monitoring for administrative users

## Real-Time Update Mechanism

### Order Confirmation Flow:
1. User confirms order on `OrderPage`
2. Backend processes order and updates database stock
3. API response includes `stockUpdate` event data
4. Frontend processes stock update and updates context
5. `localStorage.setItem('stockUpdate', ...)` broadcasts change
6. All components listening to stock context automatically refresh
7. Updated stock levels appear across all pages instantly

### Order Cancellation Flow:
1. User cancels order on `OrderPage`
2. Backend restores stock in database
3. API response includes `stockUpdate` event data
4. Frontend processes restoration and updates context
5. Real-time broadcast ensures all pages show updated stock

### Cross-Page Consistency:
- All pages use the same `StockContext` data source
- localStorage events ensure synchronization
- Automatic refresh mechanisms maintain data freshness
- Centralized API endpoint ensures consistency

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Stock Subtraction Test:
- Navigate to ProductsPage → View initial stock levels
- Go to OrderPage → Confirm an order with specific quantities
- Immediately check ProductsPage, InventoryPage, MaintenancePage
- **Expected**: Stock levels reduced by ordered quantities across all pages

### 2. Stock Restoration Test:
- Cancel the previously confirmed order
- Check all pages again
- **Expected**: Stock levels restored to original values

### 3. Real-Time Update Test:
- Open multiple browser tabs with different pages
- Perform stock operations in one tab
- **Expected**: All tabs show updated stock without manual refresh

### 4. Cross-Component Consistency Test:
- Compare stock numbers across:
  - ProductsPage product listings
  - InventoryPage stock table
  - MaintenancePage product management
  - StockStatusWidget displays
- **Expected**: All show identical stock values

## Key Features Delivered

- Stock history tracking and analytics
- Low stock notification system
- Inventory forecasting capabilities
- Multi-warehouse stock management

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start both servers**: Backend (port 3001) and Frontend (port 3000)
2. **Navigate to any page**: Stock data loads automatically
3. **Place orders**: Watch stock decrease in real-time
4. **Cancel orders**: Watch stock restore immediately
5. **Monitor via widget**: Check StockStatusWidget for overview

The implementation provides a complete, production-ready stock management system with real-time capabilities across the entire application.
