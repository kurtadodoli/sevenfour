# Admin Product Management Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive admin product management system that allows admins to add, edit, and delete products, with changes automatically reflected in the customer-facing product pages.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Admin Dashboard Product Management
- **Real-time Product CRUD Operations**: Admin can create, read, update, and delete products
- **API Integration**: All operations call the backend API endpoints
- **Automatic UI Updates**: Changes reflect immediately in the admin dashboard
- **Fallback System**: Mock data as fallback when API is unavailable

### 2. Customer Page Real-time Updates
- **Custom Hook**: `useProducts.js` for centralized product data management
- **Auto-refresh**: Products page refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Cross-tab Communication**: Changes trigger updates across browser tabs
- **Immediate Visibility**: New products added by admin appear instantly for customers

### 3. Category System
- **Predefined Categories**: T-Shirts, Hoodies, Shorts, Jackets, Accessories, Jeans, Shoes
- **Proper Mapping**: Categories map correctly between admin and customer views
- **Database Support**: Utilizes `product_categories` table with fallback options

### 4. Database Integration
- **Product Schema**: Complete product database schema with all necessary tables
