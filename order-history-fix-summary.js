console.log('🔧 ORDER HISTORY FIX APPLIED\n');

console.log('✅ ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:');
console.log('The OrderPage.js was showing ALL orders to admin users instead of their own orders.');
console.log('');
console.log('🔍 Root Cause:');
console.log('- Admin users were calling /orders endpoint (all orders)');
console.log('- Regular users were calling /orders/me-with-items (own orders only)');
console.log('- This caused admins to see orders from ALL users in their Order History');
console.log('');
console.log('🛠️ Fix Applied:');
console.log('- Changed logic to ALWAYS use /orders/me-with-items for Order History');
console.log('- Now ALL users (including admins) see only their own orders');
console.log('- Admin panel for viewing all orders should be separate');
console.log('');
console.log('📊 Expected Behavior Now:');
console.log('- New admin user (qka-adodoli@tip.edu.ph) should see 0 orders ✅');
console.log('- Existing users should see only their own orders ✅');
console.log('- No cross-user order visibility ✅');
console.log('');
console.log('🧪 To Test:');
console.log('1. Login with the admin account: qka-adodoli@tip.edu.ph / admin123');
console.log('2. Go to Order History tab');
console.log('3. Should see "You have no orders yet" message');
console.log('4. Login with other user accounts and verify they see only their orders');
console.log('');
console.log('🔒 Security Issue Resolved:');
console.log('Users can no longer see orders from other users!');

console.log('\n📝 SUMMARY:');
console.log('✅ Privacy/Security bug fixed');
console.log('✅ Order history now user-specific');
console.log('✅ Admin users see their own orders, not all orders');
console.log('✅ Frontend logic corrected');
