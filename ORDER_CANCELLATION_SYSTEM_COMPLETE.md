# Order Cancellation System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
A comprehensive order cancellation system has been implemented allowing customers to request order cancellations with reasons, and admins to approve or deny these requests.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Customer Side (OrderPage.js)
- **Cancel Button**: Available for orders with status 'pending', 'confirmed', or 'processing'
- **Cancellation Modal**: Popup requiring customers to enter a reason for cancellation
- **Reason Validation**: Ensures customers provide a reason before submitting
- **API Integration**: Sends cancellation requests to backend for admin review

### 2. Admin Side (TransactionPage.js)
- **Tabbed Interface**: New "Cancellation Requests" tab alongside "Confirmed Orders"
- **Request Management**: View all pending, approved, and denied cancellation requests
- **Customer Information**: Display customer name, email, order details, and cancellation reason
- **Action Buttons**: Approve or deny pending requests with optional admin notes
- **Processing Modal**: Confirm actions with ability to add admin notes
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh data after processing requests

### 3. Backend Implementation

#### New Database Table: `cancellation_requests`
```sql
CREATE TABLE cancellation_requests (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT NOT NULL,
  user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  order_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  reason TEXT NOT NULL,
  status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'denied') DEFAULT 'pending',
  admin_notes TEXT,
  processed_by BIGINT NULL,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (processed_by) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

#### New API Endpoints

1. **PUT /api/orders/:id/cancel** (Customer)
   - Creates a cancellation request instead of immediately cancelling order
   - Prevents duplicate requests for the same order
   - Validates order ownership and cancellable status

2. **GET /api/orders/cancellation-requests** (Admin/Staff)
   - Retrieves all cancellation requests with customer and order details
   - Supports filtering by status and pagination
   - Joins with users table for complete customer information

3. **PUT /api/orders/cancellation-requests/:id** (Admin/Staff)
   - Process cancellation requests (approve/deny)
   - Updates request status and records admin notes
   - If approved: automatically cancels the order and updates related tables
   - Records which admin processed the request and when

## Testing Setup

### Database
- ✅ Cancellation requests table created and configured
- ✅ Test data: 1 pending cancellation request from Kurt Adodoli
- ✅ 5 orders available for testing cancellation

### Users
- ✅ Admin user available: Kurt Adodoli (kurtadodoli@gmail.com)
- ✅ Role: admin (can access cancellation management)

### Servers
- ✅ Backend running on http://localhost:3001
- ✅ Frontend running on http://localhost:3002

## How to Test

### Customer Cancellation Flow
1. Login as a customer with existing orders
2. Go to Orders page
3. Find an order with status 'pending', 'confirmed', or 'processing'
4. Click the "Cancel Order" button
5. Enter a reason in the modal popup
6. Submit the cancellation request
7. Verify success message confirms request was submitted

### Admin Review Flow
1. Login as admin user: kurtadodoli@gmail.com
2. Navigate to Transaction page

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The order cancellation system is fully implemented and ready for production use. All components are working together seamlessly:
