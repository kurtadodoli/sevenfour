# COURIER DISPLAY FIX - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Summary
The issue was that newly admin-verified orders appeared in DeliveryPage.js, but when a courier was assigned to custom orders, their details were not visible in the delivery details section.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Backend Query Issue**: The delivery controller was correctly joining courier data, but many custom orders had `courier_id: null` in the delivery schedules.
2. **Frontend Issue**: The DeliveryPage.js was not sending the `courier_id` when scheduling deliveries.
3. **Data Consistency**: Some existing delivery schedules were created without courier assignments.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend Fix (DeliveryPage.js)
- **File**: `c:\sfc\client\src\pages\DeliveryPage.js`
- **Change**: Added `courier_id: scheduleData.courier_id || null` to the API request payload
- **Impact**: New courier assignments are now properly saved to the database

### 2. Data Consistency Fix
- **Manual Assignment**: Assigned Kenneth Marzan (ID: 10) to the specific order from the screenshot (CUSTOM-MCNOZFFQ-X8B36)
- **Verification**: Confirmed that courier data is now returned correctly in the API response

### 3. UI Cleanup
- **Removed**: Debug output from DeliveryPage.js as the issue is resolved
- **Maintained**: Clear visual cues for both assigned and unassigned couriers
