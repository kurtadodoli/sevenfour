# Seven Four Clothing E-Commerce System - Findings, Data, Results, and Analysis

## Project Overview and Findings

During the requirements engineering phase, the development team identified critical challenges facing small to medium-scale clothing businesses in the Philippine market, particularly in establishing a comprehensive online presence that could compete with larger e-commerce platforms while maintaining brand identity and customer engagement. The absence of an integrated system for managing inventory, custom design requests, customer relationships, and multi-channel sales created significant operational bottlenecks that limited business growth potential and customer satisfaction. These operational concerns, combined with the increasing demand for personalized clothing and the shift toward digital commerce accelerated by recent market trends, shaped the scope and functionality of the proposed Seven Four Clothing e-commerce solution.

To address these challenges, the Seven Four Clothing E-Commerce System was developed as a full-stack web application designed to serve both business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions and business operations management. The system introduces comprehensive modules for product catalog management, custom design studio functionality, inventory tracking, order processing, customer relationship management, and administrative oversight. Role-based access control ensures that customers, staff members, and administrators can access appropriate functionality while maintaining data security and operational integrity. The implementation of secure authentication mechanisms, payment processing integration, and real-time inventory management supports a robust and scalable commercial environment.

## Technical Implementation and Architecture

The system was built using modern web development technologies including React.js 18.2.0 for the frontend user interface, Node.js with Express.js for the backend API services, and MySQL 8.0+ for comprehensive data management. This technology stack enabled seamless integration of complex e-commerce functionality including real-time inventory tracking, secure user authentication, payment processing, and dynamic content management. The frontend implementation utilizes styled-components for consistent UI design, FontAwesome for iconography, and React Context API for state management across components.

The backend architecture incorporates RESTful API design principles with middleware for authentication, authorization, and data validation. Security measures include bcrypt password hashing, JWT token-based authentication, and input sanitization to prevent common web vulnerabilities. The database schema supports complex relationships between users, products, orders, custom design requests, and inventory management, with optimized queries for performance and scalability.

## Core System Modules and Functionality

### Customer-Facing Features
The Product Catalog Module enables customers to browse available products through an intuitive grid layout with advanced filtering capabilities by product type, size, color, and price range. The system supports real-time stock availability checking and provides detailed product information including high-quality images, specifications, and sizing guides. The Shopping Cart functionality allows for seamless product selection, quantity modification, and checkout processing with integrated payment verification.

The Custom Design Studio represents a unique value proposition, allowing customers to create personalized clothing designs by selecting product types, colors, sizes, and uploading custom graphics. The system calculates pricing dynamically based on design complexity and provides real-time previews of custom products. Integration with the order management system ensures smooth workflow from design submission through production approval and fulfillment.

### Administrative and Business Management
The Administrative Dashboard provides comprehensive business intelligence through user activity tracking, sales performance analytics, and inventory monitoring. The system generates detailed reports on customer behavior, product performance, and financial metrics to support data-driven decision making. Real-time notifications alert administrators to low stock levels, pending orders, and system issues.

The Transaction Management Module enables staff to process various request types including regular orders, custom design approvals, cancellation requests, and refund processing. The system implements workflow automation for order status updates, customer communications, and inventory adjustments. Payment verification capabilities support multiple payment methods including GCash, bank transfers, and other Philippine payment systems.

## Security Implementation and Data Protection

The security framework incorporates multiple algorithmic techniques to ensure robust protection of customer data and business information. Password security utilizes the bcrypt cryptographic hash algorithm with salt generation, ensuring that user credentials are stored securely and cannot be retrieved in plaintext form. The bcrypt algorithm transforms user passwords through a one-way hashing process with a cost factor of 10 rounds, as evidenced in the database where passwords are stored in the format `$2b$10$[salt][hash]`. This means that when a user enters a password like "password123", bcrypt generates a unique salt, combines it with the password, and performs 10 iterative hashing rounds to produce a secure hash like `$2b$10$ABC123...`. During authentication, the system hashes the entered password using the same process and compares it with the stored hash, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, the original passwords remain protected and computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer. The system implements JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for session management, providing secure access control across all system components.

Data encryption protocols protect sensitive information during transmission and storage, while input validation and sanitization prevent injection attacks and other common web vulnerabilities. The system enforces role-based access control (RBAC) ensuring that users can only access functionality and data appropriate to their authorization level. Regular security audits and monitoring capabilities track user activities and system access patterns to identify potential security threats.

## System Evaluation and Performance Analysis

Evaluation of the Seven Four Clothing e-commerce system was conducted through comprehensive testing scenarios involving multiple user types including customers, administrative staff, and system administrators. The evaluation framework assessed five critical criteria: Functional Suitability, Performance Efficiency, Security Implementation, Usability, and Reliability. Testing methodology included both automated testing suites and user acceptance testing with real-world scenarios.

### Functional Suitability Results
The system demonstrated comprehensive functionality across all core e-commerce operations. Product browsing, cart management, and checkout processes performed without errors during testing scenarios. The custom design studio successfully handled image uploads, design previews, and pricing calculations. Administrative functions including inventory management, order processing, and reporting generated accurate results consistently.

### Performance and Scalability Analysis
Load testing revealed the system's capability to handle concurrent user sessions effectively, with response times remaining under 2 seconds for most operations. Database query optimization resulted in efficient data retrieval even with large product catalogs and order histories. The React-based frontend demonstrated responsive performance across various devices and browser types.

### Security Assessment
Security testing confirmed the effectiveness of authentication mechanisms, with password hashing and JWT implementation providing robust access control. Input validation successfully prevented SQL injection and cross-site scripting attempts. Role-based access control functioned correctly, restricting unauthorized access to administrative functions and sensitive customer data.

### Usability and User Experience
User experience evaluation revealed high satisfaction scores for interface design, navigation intuitiveness, and overall system usability. The responsive design performed effectively across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Customer feedback indicated strong appreciation for the custom design functionality and the comprehensive order tracking capabilities.
