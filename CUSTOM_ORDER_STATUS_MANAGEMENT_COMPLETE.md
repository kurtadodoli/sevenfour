## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Production timelines stored in `customOrderProductionStartDates`
- Status updates handled through existing `handleUpdateDeliveryStatus`
- Calendar timeline automatically updates based on order status

### Visual Updates
- Progress bars turn green when order is delivered
- All timeline days show 100% when order is delivered
- Tooltips update to show delivery status
- Buttons dynamically appear/disappear based on order status

### Data Flow
- Setting production start date enables status buttons
- Status changes affect timeline visualization
- Delayed/cancelled orders remove timeline data
- Restore/reschedule operations reset timeline capability
