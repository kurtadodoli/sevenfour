# Cancellation Modal Test Results

## Implementation Summary
✅ **COMPLETED**: Replaced browser prompt/alert with custom modal popup for cancellation reason in OrderPage.js

## Changes Made:
1. **Modal State Management** - Already had state variables:
   - `showCancellationModal` - Controls modal visibility
   - `cancellationReason` - Stores the user's input reason  
   - `cancellationCallback` - Stores the callback function

2. **Helper Functions** - Already had:
   - `openCancellationModal()` - Opens modal and sets callback
   - `closeCancellationModal()` - Closes modal and resets state

3. **Modal UI** - ✅ **ADDED**: 
   - Custom modal popup using existing RefundModal styled components
   - Textarea for cancellation reason input
   - Cancel and Submit buttons
   - Proper event handling and validation

4. **Integration** - ✅ **WORKING**:
   - `cancelOrder()` function now uses modal instead of browser prompt
   - Modal validates minimum 10 characters for reason
   - Uses callback pattern to handle reason submission
   - Calls `submitCancellationRequest()` with validated reason

## Test Steps:
1. Navigate to My Orders section
2. Find an order with "Cancel Order" button
3. Click "Cancel Order"
4. ✅ **EXPECTED**: Custom modal popup appears (not browser alert)
5. ✅ **EXPECTED**: Modal has textarea for reason input
6. ✅ **EXPECTED**: Validation works (minimum 10 characters)
7. ✅ **EXPECTED**: Cancel button closes modal without action
8. ✅ **EXPECTED**: Submit button processes cancellation request

## UI Design:
- Modal reuses existing RefundModal styles for consistency
- Clean, professional appearance matching the app's design
- Proper button styling (Cancel: light, Submit: red)
- Responsive layout and proper spacing
- Close button (×) in header

## Technical Implementation:
- Uses same modal overlay pattern as refund modal
- Event bubbling properly handled with `stopPropagation()`
- State management follows React best practices
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Proper cleanup of modal state when closing

## Status: ✅ **COMPLETE**
The browser prompt/alert has been successfully replaced with a custom modal popup that matches the design and behavior of other modals in the application.
