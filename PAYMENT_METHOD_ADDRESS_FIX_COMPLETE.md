### ðŸ“Š IMPACT SUMMARY

**Before Fix**:
- Frontend defaulted to "Cash on Delivery" when payment method was missing
- Some orders displayed "COD" in transaction lists
- Address fields showed "N/A" even when partial data was available
- Database had mixed payment methods (cash_on_delivery vs gcash)

**After Fix**:
- Frontend consistently displays "GCash" as the payment method
- All database records use 'gcash' as payment method
- Enhanced address display logic reduces unnecessary "N/A" displays
- Consistent user experience across all order types
