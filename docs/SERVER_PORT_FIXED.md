ðŸ”§ SERVER PORT CONFIGURATION FIXED! 

## What Was Fixed:
1. âœ… Killed the process using port 3001 (PID 26364)
2. âœ… Updated server/app.js default port from 3001 to 5000  
3. âœ… Updated server/.env PORT from 3001 to 5000

## Your Server is Now Configured Correctly:
- Server will run on **port 5000**
- Client is configured to connect to **port 5000** 
- API endpoint: `http://localhost:5000/api/inventory/overview-test`

## Next Steps:

### 1. Start the Server
In your current PowerShell window (C:\sevenfour), run:
```bash
npm run server
```

You should now see:
```
ðŸš€ Server running on port 5000
ðŸ“Š Frontend should connect to: http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Test the API
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/inventory/overview-test
```

You should see JSON data with your products and stock levels.

### 3. Test the InventoryPage
Go back to your browser with the InventoryPage and refresh or click "Try Again".

## Expected Results:
âœ… Server starts successfully on port 5000
âœ… API returns product data with stock levels  
âœ… InventoryPage loads and displays correct stock numbers
âœ… Stock numbers match your MaintenancePage

The inventory system should now work perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
