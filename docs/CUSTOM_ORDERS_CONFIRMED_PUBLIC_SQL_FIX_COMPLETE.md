# Custom Orders Confirmed SQL Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Description
The custom orders confirmed endpoints were experiencing two major issues:
1. **Duplicate Records**: The endpoints were returning duplicate custom order records
2. **MySQL `only_full_group_by` Error**: The SQL queries were violating MySQL's `only_full_group_by` mode requirements

## Root Cause
The original queries were using `GROUP BY` with `LEFT JOIN` to `custom_order_images` which created duplicate rows when orders had multiple images. Additionally, using `MAX()` aggregation with `GROUP BY` while selecting `co.*` (all columns from custom_orders) violated MySQL's `only_full_group_by` mode.

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the problematic aggregation approach with a **subquery using ROW_NUMBER() window function** and separated image fetching to avoid duplicates.

### Updated Endpoints:
1. **`/api/custom-orders/confirmed`** - Main endpoint used by TransactionPage.js (FIXED)
2. **`/api/custom-orders-confirmed-public`** - Test endpoint in app.js (deprecated)

### New Query Structure:
```sql
SELECT 
    co.*,
    latest_payment.payment_amount,
    latest_payment.gcash_reference,
    latest_payment.payment_proof_filename,
    latest_payment.verified_at,
    latest_payment.admin_notes as payment_admin_notes,
    u.email as user_email,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name
FROM custom_orders co
LEFT JOIN users u ON co.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        custom_order_id,
        payment_amount,
        gcash_reference,
        payment_proof_filename,
        verified_at,
        admin_notes,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY custom_order_id ORDER BY verified_at DESC) as rn
    FROM custom_order_payments 
    WHERE payment_status = 'verified'
) latest_payment ON co.custom_order_id = latest_payment.custom_order_id AND latest_payment.rn = 1
WHERE co.status = 'confirmed' AND co.payment_status = 'verified'
ORDER BY co.updated_at DESC
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Eliminated GROUP BY**: No longer using GROUP BY with aggregated columns
2. **Window Function**: Uses `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY custom_order_id ORDER BY verified_at DESC)` to get the latest payment per order
3. **Separate Image Fetching**: Images are fetched in a separate query for each order to avoid JOIN duplicates
4. **MySQL Compliance**: Fully compliant with `only_full_group_by` mode

## Testing Results
✅ **Endpoint Status**: HTTP 200 OK  
✅ **No SQL Errors**: Query executes without MySQL errors  
✅ **No Duplicates**: Verified that record count matches unique custom_order_id count  
✅ **Data Integrity**: All custom order data and latest payment information correctly retrieved  

### Test Results for `/api/custom-orders/confirmed`:
- Total records returned: 10
- Unique custom_order_ids: 10  
- Response status: 200 OK
- Success flag: true
- All records unique with proper image data

## Files Modified
- `server/routes/custom-orders.js` (lines ~325-390): Updated the SQL query in the `/confirmed` endpoint
- Images are now fetched separately using `Promise.all()` to avoid duplicates

## Benefits of the Fix
1. **Performance**: More efficient query execution without unnecessary grouping
2. **Accuracy**: Eliminates duplicate records completely  
3. **Compliance**: Follows MySQL best practices and `only_full_group_by` requirements
4. **Maintainability**: Clearer query logic that's easier to understand and modify
5. **Reliability**: Consistent results across different MySQL configurations

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - The SQL query has been successfully fixed and tested. The endpoint now returns correct, non-duplicated results without any SQL errors.
