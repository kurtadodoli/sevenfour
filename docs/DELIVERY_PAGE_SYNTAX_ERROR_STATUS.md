# Delivery Page Syntax Error Status

## Changes Made
- Fixed spacing and formatting issues in DeliveryPage.js
- Fixed indentation in custom orders section
- Fixed missing line breaks and improved code formatting
- Added proper closing braces to if-else blocks in handleScheduleDelivery function
- Fixed missing braces in try-catch blocks

## Current Status
The file still has a syntax error at line 2356:
```javascript
} catch (error) {
```
The error suggests that there's no matching try block for this catch statement.

## Next Steps
1. The handleScheduleDelivery function may need to be completely rewritten with proper structure
2. Consider extracting parts of the function into smaller, more manageable helper functions
3. Verify brace matching throughout the entire function
4. Test the approach of commenting out problematic sections and gradually reintroducing them

## For Review
This fix has been committed to GitHub but still requires additional work to resolve the syntax error.
