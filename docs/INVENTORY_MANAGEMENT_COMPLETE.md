# INVENTORY MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Overview
Implemented automatic inventory management that adjusts product stock when orders are confirmed and restores stock when orders are cancelled.

## Database Schema Used

### Products Table Fields:
- `total_available_stock`: Stock available for purchase
- `total_reserved_stock`: Stock reserved for confirmed orders
- `stock_status`: Enum ('in_stock', 'low_stock', 'critical_stock', 'out_of_stock')
- `last_stock_update`: Timestamp of last stock change

### Order Flow:
1. **Order Creation**: No inventory impact (stock remains available)
2. **Order Confirmation**: Stock is reserved (available decreases, reserved increases)
3. **Order Cancellation**: Stock is restored (available increases, reserved decreases)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Order Confirmation (`confirmOrder` function)

**When an order is confirmed:**
```sql
-- For each order item:
UPDATE products 
SET total_available_stock = total_available_stock - [quantity],
    total_reserved_stock = total_reserved_stock + [quantity],
    last_stock_update = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    stock_status = CASE 
        WHEN (total_available_stock - [quantity]) <= 0 THEN 'out_of_stock'
        WHEN (total_available_stock - [quantity]) <= 5 THEN 'critical_stock'
        WHEN (total_available_stock - [quantity]) <= 15 THEN 'low_stock'
        ELSE 'in_stock'
    END
WHERE product_id = [product_id]
```

**Features:**
- ✅ **Stock Validation**: Checks if sufficient stock is available before confirming
- ✅ **Atomic Transaction**: All inventory updates happen in a single transaction
- ✅ **Stock Status Update**: Automatically updates stock status based on remaining quantity
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Rolls back if insufficient stock is found
- ✅ **Detailed Logging**: Logs inventory changes for each product

### 2. Order Cancellation (`processCancellationRequest` function)

**When a cancellation is approved:**
```sql
-- For each order item:
UPDATE products 
SET total_available_stock = total_available_stock + [quantity],
    total_reserved_stock = GREATEST(0, total_reserved_stock - [quantity]),
    last_stock_update = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    stock_status = CASE 
        WHEN (total_available_stock + [quantity]) <= 0 THEN 'out_of_stock'
        WHEN (total_available_stock + [quantity]) <= 5 THEN 'critical_stock'
        WHEN (total_available_stock + [quantity]) <= 15 THEN 'low_stock'
        ELSE 'in_stock'
    END
WHERE product_id = [product_id]
```

**Features:**
- ✅ **Stock Restoration**: Returns reserved stock back to available inventory
- ✅ **Safe Decrement**: Uses GREATEST(0, ...) to prevent negative reserved stock
- ✅ **Status Recalculation**: Updates stock status when inventory is restored
- ✅ **Transaction Safety**: Part of the cancellation approval transaction

## Stock Status Levels

| Status | Condition | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `in_stock` | Available > 15 | Normal stock level |
| `low_stock` | Available ≤ 15 | Should reorder soon |
| `critical_stock` | Available ≤ 5 | Urgent reorder needed |
| `out_of_stock` | Available ≤ 0 | Cannot fulfill new orders |

## User Experience Flow

### Order Confirmation Flow:
1. User clicks "Confirm Order" on pending order
2. System checks if all items have sufficient stock
3. If insufficient stock: Returns error with details about which items lack stock
4. If sufficient stock: 
   - Deducts quantities from available stock
   - Adds quantities to reserved stock
   - Updates stock status for each product
   - Confirms the order

### Order Cancellation Flow:
1. User submits cancellation request
2. Admin approves cancellation
3. System automatically:
   - Returns reserved quantities back to available stock
   - Updates stock status to reflect restored inventory
   - Marks order as cancelled

## Error Handling

### Insufficient Stock on Confirmation:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Insufficient stock for some items",
  "insufficientStock": [
    {
      "product": "Product Name",
      "requested": 10,
      "available": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

### Transaction Rollback:
- All inventory operations use database transactions
- If any step fails, all changes are rolled back
- Ensures data consistency and prevents partial updates

## Integration with Existing Systems

### MaintenancePage Integration:
- Stock changes are immediately reflected in maintenance views
- `total_available_stock` is the source of truth for inventory displays

### InventoryPage Integration:
- Real-time stock levels shown based on `total_available_stock`
- Stock status indicators help identify items needing attention

## Files Modified

1. **`server/controllers/orderController.js`**:
   - Enhanced `confirmOrder` function with inventory deduction
   - Enhanced `processCancellationRequest` function with inventory restoration

## Testing and Validation

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Test Order Confirmation**:
   - Create order with items that have sufficient stock
   - Confirm order and verify stock decreases
   - Check stock status updates appropriately

2. **Test Insufficient Stock**:
   - Try to confirm order with items that don't have enough stock
   - Verify error message and no stock changes

3. **Test Order Cancellation**:
   - Cancel a confirmed order
   - Verify stock is restored to available inventory
   - Check stock status updates when inventory increases

### Database Verification:
```sql
-- Check stock changes for a specific product
SELECT 
  productname,
  total_available_stock,
  total_reserved_stock,
  stock_status,
  last_stock_update
FROM products 
WHERE product_id = [product_id];
```

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Inventory Tracking**: No manual stock adjustments needed
2. **Prevents Overselling**: Stock validation before order confirmation
3. **Accurate Stock Levels**: Real-time inventory updates across all systems
4. **Audit Trail**: `last_stock_update` timestamps for tracking changes
5. **Status Indicators**: Automated stock status helps with reordering decisions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Stock Movement Log**: Track all inventory changes with reasons
2. **Low Stock Alerts**: Email notifications when stock reaches critical levels
3. **Automatic Reordering**: Integration with supplier systems
4. **Stock Reservations**: Temporary holds on inventory during checkout process

This implementation ensures that inventory is accurately tracked throughout the order lifecycle and prevents common e-commerce issues like overselling and incorrect stock displays.
