üìã STOCK DISPLAY FIX SUMMARY
============================

üéØ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- ProductDetailsPage.js was showing incorrect stock numbers in size buttons when a color was selected
- Example: SF T-shirt Small had 45 Blue available and 50 Red available
- But UI showed 45 for both Red and Blue when any color was selected

üîß ROOT CAUSE:
- Size buttons were displaying total stock for all colors combined in that size
- When user selected a color, size buttons still showed total instead of color-specific stock

‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Modified ProductDetailsPage.js size button display logic
- Now shows stock for the specific selected color + size combination
- Uses existing getStockForSizeAndColor() function for accurate calculation

üìä CURRENT SF PRODUCT STOCK (Verification):
Size | Color | Available | Reserved | Expected UI Display
-----|-------|-----------|----------|-------------------
S    | Blue  | 45        | 5        | "S (45 available)" when Blue selected
S    | Red   | 50        | 0        | "S (50 available)" when Red selected  
M    | Blue  | 50        | 0        | "M (50 available)" when Blue selected
M    | Red   | 50        | 0        | "M (50 available)" when Red selected
L    | Blue  | 50        | 0        | "L (50 available)" when Blue selected
L    | Red   | 50        | 0        | "L (50 available)" when Red selected

üéØ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
1. User visits SF product page
2. Selects "Blue" color
3. Size buttons now show:
   - S (45 available) ‚Üê Correct! 5 were ordered
   - M (50 available) ‚Üê Correct! None ordered
   - L (50 available) ‚Üê Correct! None ordered

4. User switches to "Red" color
5. Size buttons now show:
   - S (50 available) ‚Üê Correct! None ordered
   - M (50 available) ‚Üê Correct! None ordered  
   - L (50 available) ‚Üê Correct! None ordered

üöÄ STATUS: FIX COMPLETE
- ProductDetailsPage.js updated with color-specific stock display
- React development server restarted with new code
- Stock management system maintains accurate variant-level tracking
- Frontend now shows precise stock for each size/color combination
