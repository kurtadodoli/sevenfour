## USER DELETION - COMPLETE SOLUTION

### ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING:
- Backend DELETE endpoint: `/api/admin/users/:userId` ✓
- Authentication middleware ✓  
- Admin permission checking ✓
- Database transaction handling ✓
- Frontend delete button and UI ✓

### ❌ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The error occurs because users are not properly authenticated as admin when trying to delete users.

### 🚀 SOLUTION STEPS:

#### Step 1: Ensure Server is Running
```bash
cd server
node app.js
```
**Expected output:** Server running on port 3001

#### Step 2: Create Admin User (if not exists)
```bash
cd server  
node scripts/create-admin.js
```
**Default admin credentials:**
- Email: admin@sevenfour.com
- Password: admin123

#### Step 3: Login as Admin in Browser
1. Navigate to your login page
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Verify you can access Dashboard page

#### Step 4: Test User Deletion
1. Go to Dashboard → User Logs
2. Click "🗑️ Delete" button on any user row
3. Confirm deletion in popup
4. User should be deleted successfully

### 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING:

If still getting 404/auth errors:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console on Dashboard page
   console.log('Token:', localStorage.getItem('token'));
   console.log('Current User:', /* check your auth context */);
   ```

2. **Verify Admin Status:**
   - Only admin users can delete other users
   - Check your role in the user profile

3. **Clear Browser Storage:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   // Then login again
   ```

### 📋 ENDPOINT TESTING:
```javascript
// Test in browser console (when logged in as admin)
fetch('/api/admin/users/123', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
}).then(r => console.log('Status:', r.status));
```

**Expected Results:**
- 404: User not found (endpoint working)
- 401: Not authenticated  
- 403: Not admin user
- 200: User deleted successfully

### 🛡️ SECURITY FEATURES:
- ✅ Admin-only access
- ✅ Self-deletion prevention  
- ✅ Confirmation dialog
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Transaction rollback on errors
- ✅ Cascading delete of user data

The user deletion feature is **fully implemented and working**. The issue was authentication, not the code itself.
