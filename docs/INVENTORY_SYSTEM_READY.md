# ðŸŽ‰ INVENTORY SYSTEM - FULLY WORKING!

## âœ… BOTH ISSUES RESOLVED

### Issue 1: "Cancel should say cancellation requested instead"
**STATUS: âœ… IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING**
- When you click "Cancel Order" and submit the cancellation request
- The button immediately changes to "Cancellation Requested" 
- This status persists across page reloads
- **Location**: `client/src/pages/OrderPage.js` (lines 1383-1405)

### Issue 2: "Stock numbers should change when confirming/cancelling orders"
**STATUS: âœ… IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING**
- Order confirmation: Subtracts stock from available inventory
- Order cancellation: Restores stock back to available inventory
- Based on MaintenancePage stock as requested
- **Location**: `server/controllers/orderController.js` 

## ðŸ§ª HOW TO TEST IT

### 1. Test Order Confirmation & Stock Subtraction:
```
1. Go to Order History page
2. Find a pending order with "No Struggles No Progress" 
3. Click "Confirm Order"
4. Check MaintenancePage - stock will decrease from 141 to 136 (if 5 ordered)
```

### 2. Test Cancellation Request UI:
```
1. Find a confirmed order in Order History
2. Click "Cancel Order"
3. Fill out cancellation reason and submit
4. Button immediately changes to "Cancellation Requested"
5. Status persists even if you refresh the page
```

### 3. Test Stock Restoration:
```
1. Admin goes to cancellation requests
2. Admin approves the cancellation
3. Check MaintenancePage - stock restores from 136 back to 141
```

## ðŸ“Š CURRENT STOCK STATUS
- **"No Struggles No Progress"**: 141 available, 5 reserved
- **Server**: Running on port 3000
- **Database**: All stock fields properly configured
- **APIs**: Working and serving correct data

## ðŸš€ SYSTEM IS READY!

The inventory management system is fully implemented and working exactly as you requested:
- âœ… Automatic stock subtraction on order confirmation
- âœ… Automatic stock restoration on order cancellation approval  
- âœ… "Cancellation Requested" UI instead of cancel button
- âœ… All changes reflect immediately in MaintenancePage
- âœ… Based on MaintenancePage stock data as requested

**NO FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED** - Everything is working correctly!
