# ORDER CANCELLATION REQUEST UI IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes (server/controllers/orderController.js)

1. **Modified `getUserOrders` function** to include cancellation request information:
   - Added LEFT JOIN with `cancellation_requests` table
   - Now returns `cancellation_status`, `cancellation_reason`, and `cancellation_requested_at` fields
   - Only shows pending cancellation requests (status = 'pending')

2. **Modified `getUserOrdersWithItems` function** with the same cancellation request information

### Frontend Changes (client/src/pages/OrderPage.js)

1. **Updated Cancel Button Logic** in the order history section:
   - **Before**: Cancel button was shown for orders with status 'pending', 'confirmed', or 'processing'
   - **After**: 
     - If `order.cancellation_status === 'pending'`: Shows "Cancellation Requested" badge instead of cancel button
     - If no pending cancellation: Shows cancel button for cancellable orders
     - Badge styling: Yellow/amber background with professional appearance

### UI Behavior

1. **Initial State**: User sees "Cancel Order" button for cancellable orders
2. **After Clicking Cancel**: User fills out cancellation form and submits
3. **After Submission**: 
   - Backend creates cancellation request with status 'pending'
   - Frontend refreshes order list (`fetchOrders()` is called)
   - Order now shows "Cancellation Requested" instead of cancel button
4. **After Page Reload**: Status persists because it's based on database state

### Database Schema

The implementation relies on the existing `cancellation_requests` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE cancellation_requests (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT NOT NULL,
  user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  order_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  reason TEXT NOT NULL,
  status ENUM('pending','approved','denied') DEFAULT 'pending',
  admin_notes TEXT,
  processed_by BIGINT,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Testing

1. **Database Test**: Confirmed cancellation_requests table exists and has data
2. **Query Test**: Verified the modified getUserOrders query returns cancellation status
3. **Existing Data**: Found orders with pending cancellation requests already in the system

## User Experience Flow

1. User goes to Order History tab
2. User sees orders with either:
   - "Cancel Order" button (for cancellable orders without pending requests)
   - "Cancellation Requested" badge (for orders with pending cancellation requests)
3. When user submits cancellation request:
   - Cancel button disappears immediately after successful submission
   - "Cancellation Requested" appears in its place
   - Status persists across page reloads and sessions

## Technical Details

- **Persistence**: UI state is driven by database state, not local state
- **Real-time Updates**: Order list refreshes after cancellation submission
- **Error Handling**: Existing error handling for cancellation API calls
- **Styling**: Consistent with existing glassmorphic design system

## Files Modified

1. `server/controllers/orderController.js` - Added cancellation status to order queries
2. `client/src/pages/OrderPage.js` - Updated cancel button logic with conditional rendering

This implementation ensures that the cancellation request UI state is reliable, persistent, and based on the actual database state rather than temporary frontend state.
