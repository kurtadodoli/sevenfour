# Placeholder Image and Proxy Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Proxy Configuration Mismatch
**Problem**: The React app was configured to proxy requests to `http://localhost:5001`, but the backend server runs on port `5000`.

**Solution**: Updated `client/package.json` to use the correct proxy configuration:
```json
{
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
}
```

### 2. Missing Placeholder Image
**Problem**: The code was trying to load `/placeholder-image.png` but this file didn't exist, causing 500 Internal Server Errors.

**Solution**: 
- Created `client/public/placeholder-image.svg` as a fallback image
- Updated `client/src/pages/TransactionPage.js` to reference the SVG file instead of PNG

## Files Modified

1. **client/package.json**
   - Changed proxy from `http://localhost:5001` to `http://localhost:5000`

2. **client/public/placeholder-image.svg** (new file)
   - Created a simple SVG placeholder image with "No Image Available" text

3. **client/src/pages/TransactionPage.js**
   - Updated placeholder image references from `/placeholder-image.png` to `/placeholder-image.svg`

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd server && node app.js
   ```

2. **Start the React development server**:
   ```bash
   cd client && npm start
   ```

3. **Test the placeholder image**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/placeholder-image.svg
   ```

4. **Navigate to the Transaction page** in your browser and verify that:
   - No more proxy errors appear in the console
   - Missing product images show the placeholder instead of causing errors
   - The page loads without 500 Internal Server Errors

## Result

- ✅ Proxy errors resolved
- ✅ Placeholder images display correctly for missing product images
- ✅ No more 500 Internal Server Errors for missing images
- ✅ Better user experience with proper fallback images
